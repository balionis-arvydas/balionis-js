This project is meant to remind me the sceleton of React app generated (and stripped of useless ads) by

`npm init react-app balionis-react0`

## Build

`npm install --verbose`

`npm run start`

_Note: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser._

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
